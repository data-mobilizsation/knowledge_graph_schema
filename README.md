# knowledge_graph_schema
Knowledge Graph Schema Design and Implementation

## Goal
Collaborate on knowledge graph schema design and implementation with groups using knowledge graphs / labelled property graphs for data mobilisation.

## Methods
Using formats such as csv, excel, google sheets or even Rshiny to design schema

Using tools such as R and Python to interface and implement schema into knowledge graph technologies such as NEO4j

## GUI
Graphical User Interface controlled by the schema

### TODO

Move this repo to a place on github that will allow us all to edit together (Currenly MSA organisation which isn't appropriate for this right now)

Create a 'schema' only graph for testing/editing collaboratively

Start to build a GUI that is informed by the schema nodes/relationships that exist within the database (using test database above)
